# This is a simple NLP project using the Gensim Doc2Vec library for learning and generating the class vectors of reviews(1 to 5) and then running the test reviews by computing the cosine similarity with these vectors. Each test review is given a rating of that particular class which it has the maximum cosine similarity value.
